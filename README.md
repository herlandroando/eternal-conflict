# Eternal Conflict
"Eternal Conflict" is a multiplayer online role-playing game (RPG) that combines strategic elements similar to Civilization with line-based movement mechanics but everything in this will be controlled by the dice. Players are divided into two opposing factions: Humans and Demons. The game focuses on resource management, strategic planning, and tactical combat.
## How To Play
Gameplay is being worked on but broadly speaking you will be divided into two camps of humans and demons. The human camp that is chosen to be the hero must protect their city from demon attacks and must defeat the demon king. For the devil himself must destroy the core of human life in the human castle and keep the demon king from attacking the hero.

The maximum to play in the human camp is 6 people, of which 3 are heroes while 1 person is a resource collector. 1 person becomes the supreme commander. While the demon camp, the maximum people to play is 3 people. 2 people become the highest demon troops, and 1 person becomes the demon king.
